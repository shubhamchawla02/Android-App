# Android-App
Android-App-This research is aimed to develop a frequency detector application in real time for musicians. Notes in music are always the first part for a musician to learn and then they can proceed to chords which are none other than a combination of these notes.
The objective was to find an accurate fundamental frequency detection algorithm better than the basic methods for example autocorrelation or zero crossing. The common methods are fast and efficient but are not very accurate in the environment with disturbances. My problem here is to work with monophonic sound signals and find the fundamental frequency or the first harmonic in the signal. My work will be an Android Application which will help the people those who are into music or those who are learning to play instruments such as guitar or piano. A java library has been used “Tarsos DSP” which is based on audio processing. This work contains technical and theoretical parts describing the process of implementation to testing and summarizing the work for bachelor’s thesis.
